Exercise 5: How Many Runners Participate in Each Event

Exercise:
Display the event name and the number of club members that take part in this event (call this column runner_count). Note that there may be events in which no club members participate. For these events, the runner_count should equal 0.

Query:

SELECT 
    e.name AS event_name,
    COUNT(re.runner_id) AS runner_count
FROM event e
LEFT JOIN runner_event re 
    ON e.id = re.event_id
GROUP BY e.id, e.name
ORDER BY e.name;
