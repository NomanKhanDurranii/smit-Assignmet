Exercise 7: List the Top 3 Most Expensive Orders

Exercise:
Create a dense ranking of the orders based on their total_amount. The bigger the amount, the higher the order should be. If two orders have the same total_amount, the older order should go higher (you'll have to add the column order_date to the ordering). Name the ranking column rank. After that, select only the orders with the three highest dense rankings. Show the rank, order_id, and total_amount.
